                            If you do not know SQL or basic database
                            concepts, this site is not going to be very useful to you.  However, if you are a database developer, there are a few
                            different use-cases of Trino Fiddle intended for you:
                        </p>

                    <p>
                        <span class="use_case">You want help with a tricky query, and you'd like to post a question to a Q/A site like
                        <a href="http://stackoverflow.com" title="Awesome Q &amp; A site"><span class="label label-info">StackOverflow</span></a>.</span>  Build a
                        representative database (schema and data) and post a link to it in your question.  Unique
                        URLs for each database (and each query) will be generated as you use the site; just copy and paste the
                        URL that you want to share, and it will be available for anyone who wants to take a look.  They will
                        then be able to use your DDL and your SQL as a starting point for answering your question.  When they
                        have something they'd like to share with you, they can then send you a link back to their query.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="use_case">You want to quickly run Trino queries on a dataset in the Galaxy sample dataset, or your own small dataset.

                        whole installation for your evaluation; just create your database and queries here!

                    <p>
                        The Schema DDL that is provided is used to generate a private database on the fly.  If anything is changed in your
                        DDL (even a single space!), then you will be prompted to generate a new schema and will be operating in a new database.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All SQL queries are run within a transaction that gets immediately rolled-back after the SQL executes.  This is so
                        that the underlying database structure does not change from query to query, which makes it possible to share anonymously
                        online with any number of users (each of whom may be writing queries in the same shared database, potentially modifying
                        the structure and thus -- if not for the rollback -- each other's results).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As you create schemas and write queries, unique URLs that refer to your particular schema and query will be
                        visible in your address bar.  You can share these with anyone, and they will be able to see what you've done
                        so far.  You will also be able to use your normal browser functions like 'back', 'forward', and 'reload', and you
                        will see the various stages of your work, as you would expect.

                    </p>

                <a name="terminators"></a>

                <div class="span12 pull-left hr-bar">
                    <hr>
                </div>
                <div class="span12 panel">
                    <h2>What's up with that [ ; ] button under each panel?</h2>
                    <p>
                        This obscure little button determines how the queries in each of the panels get broken up before they
                        are sent off to the database.  This button pops open a dropdown that lists different "query terminators."
                        Query terminators are used as a flag to indicate (when present at the end of a line) that the current statement
                        has ended.  The terminator does not get sent to the database; instead, it merely idicates how I should parse the
                        text before I execute the query.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Oftentimes, you won't need to touch this button; the main value this feature will have is in defining stored procedures.
                        This is because it is often the case that within a stored procedure's body definition, you might want to end a line with a
                        semicolon (this is often the case). Since my default query terminator is also a semicolon, there is no obvious way for me to
                        see that your stored procedure's semicolon isn't actually the end of the query.  Left with the semicolon terminator, I would break up your procedure
                        definition into incorrect parts, and errors would certainly result.  Changing the query terminator to something other
                        than a semicolon avoids this problem.

                        Trino Fiddle is a modification of <a href=http://sqlfiddle.com/about.html>SQLFiddle.com</a> which was built by <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/808921/jake-feasel"><span class="label">Jake Feasel</span></a>. The Developer Relations team at Starburst saw an opportunity to utilize the concept of SQLFiddle, just explicitely tied to play with Trino SQL versus multiple SQL dialects. The site is backed by Starburst's SaaS product, Starburst Galaxy, which runs Trino under the hood without altering any SQL. 
                     </p>

                     <p>
                         One of the fantastic opportunities that running this application over Starburst Galaxy, is that it has access to the default datasets that come in Galaxy. These can easily be explored by querying <pre>SHOW TABLES IN sample.demo;</pre>
